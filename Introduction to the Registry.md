# Getting Started with the Windows Registry
## A Beginner's Guide

### What is the Windows Registry?
Think of the Windows Registry as your computer's filing cabinet. It's a central database where Windows and your programs store their settings and important information. Just like a filing cabinet has different drawers and folders, the Registry has different sections that organize different types of information.

Some examples of what's stored in the Registry:
- Programs that start when Windows boots up
- Your recently opened files
- USB devices you've plugged in
- User account settings
- Program settings and preferences

### Accessing the Registry

There are several ways to open the Registry Editor (also called "regedit"):

1. **Using Run:**
   - Press `Windows key + R` on your keyboard
   - Type `regedit`
   - Click OK or press Enter
   
2. **Using Search:**
   - Click the Windows Start button
   - Type `regedit`
   - Click on "Registry Editor"

3. **Using Command Prompt:**
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type `regedit`
   - Press Enter

> ðŸ”” **Note:** Windows will show a User Account Control (UAC) prompt asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" This is normal - click Yes.

### Understanding the Registry Structure

#### The Main Sections (Hives)
When you open the Registry Editor, you'll see five main sections called "hives". Think of these as the main drawers in our filing cabinet:

- **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)**
  - Stores file association and COM object information
  - Determines which program opens which file type

- **HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)**
  - Contains settings for the currently logged-in user
  - Stores your personal Windows settings

- **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)**
  - Stores system-wide settings that apply to all users
  - Contains hardware and software configurations

- **HKEY_USERS (HKU)**
  - Contains settings for ALL users on the computer
  - Your current user settings are part of this

- **HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)**
  - Stores information about your current hardware profile
  - Contains current system settings

### Navigating the Registry

#### Basic Navigation
1. The Registry works like File Explorer:
   - Click the `>` arrow to expand a section
   - Click the `v` arrow to collapse a section
   - Double-click an item to see its contents

2. Using the address bar:
   - Click in the address bar to type a path
   - Copy/paste Registry paths to jump directly to locations

#### Finding Things
1. **Using Find** (very helpful!):
   - Press `Ctrl + F`
   - Type what you're looking for
   - Click "Find Next"
   - Press F3 to keep searching

2. **Using the tree structure:**
   - Left panel shows the hierarchy
   - Right panel shows the contents
   - Click through folders like in File Explorer

### Registry Components

#### Keys
- Think of these as folders
- They can contain other keys (subfolders) or values
- Example: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows`

#### Values
- Think of these as files
- They store the actual data
- Have three main parts:
  1. Name (like a file name)
  2. Type (like a file type)
  3. Data (the actual content)

#### Common Value Types
- **String (REG_SZ):** Regular text
- **Binary (REG_BINARY):** Raw data
- **DWORD (REG_DWORD):** Numbers
- **Multi-String (REG_MULTI_SZ):** Multiple text lines
- **Expandable String (REG_EXPAND_SZ):** Text with variables

### Safety Tips

ðŸš¨ **Important Safety Rules:**
1. Never modify Registry values unless you're absolutely sure what they do
2. For learning and forensics, just observe - don't change anything
3. If you accidentally modify something, immediately press Ctrl+Z to undo
4. When in doubt, ask your instructor

### Practice Navigation Exercise

Try this safe navigation exercise:
1. Open Registry Editor
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop`
3. Look at (but don't change) the wallpaper setting
4. Use Find (Ctrl+F) to search for "wallpaper"
5. Notice how many places store wallpaper information

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + F`: Find
- `F3`: Find Next
- `Ctrl + Left Arrow`: Collapse current section
- `Ctrl + Right Arrow`: Expand current section
- `Ctrl + Z`: Undo (very important!)

### What's Next?
After getting comfortable with navigation:
1. Start exploring common forensic locations
2. Learn about Registry analysis tools
3. Practice documenting findings
4. Learn about Registry artifacts in investigations

### Need Help?
- Ask your instructor if you're unsure about anything
- Never guess when working with the Registry
- Take notes as you explore
- Practice safe browsing - look but don't touch!
